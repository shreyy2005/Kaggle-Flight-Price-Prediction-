# Kaggle-Flight-Price-Prediction-


# Flight Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict flight prices based on various features such as duration, days left until departure, class, source city, destination city, airline, departure time, and arrival time. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.

## Problem Statement
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze if flight prices vary among different airlines.
- To investigate how the price is affected when tickets are bought just 1 or 2 days before departure.
- To determine if ticket prices change based on the departure and arrival times.
- To analyze how the price changes with changes in source and destination cities.
- To compare the ticket prices between economy and business class.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various features related to flight details and prices.

## Methodology
The project involves:
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and visualize distributions of features.
- Building regression models to predict flight prices, including Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression, XGBoost Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression.
- Evaluating the models using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

## Getting Started
